Open a TCP socket
    Bind to a port of your choosing
    Loop forever
        Accept a connection to your socket (returns socket for the client that connected)
        Read the data from client socket, expecting GET /<filename>
        if file found
            Open file with filename and read contents into a buffer of bytes
            Send via the client socket
                Create HTTP OK message headers (see slide 102 from class, just the status line will suffice)
                // chunk buffer where each size(chunk + header) < max TCP packet size 
                // (or find a command to handle chunking for you)
            	Create a message for each chunk of the buffer
                	Concatenate HTTP OK header and chunk bytes
            		Append "\r\n" (carriage return and new line) to the end
            		Send this appended message out the client socket
        else
            Send "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\r\n\r\n <html><head></head><body><h1>404 Not Found</h1></body></html>\r\n" message
        Close client socket
